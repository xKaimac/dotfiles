# Firefox styling changes

This is just a styling change to follow the theme of my [SwayWM](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) setup, which uses [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

## Usage
1. Paste this styling in the same directory location shown in these dotfiles.

   1a. Alternatively, navigate to `about:support`.

   1b. Under `Application Basics/Profile Folder`, click on the `Open Folder` button.
3. Navigate to `about:config` in the URL bar.
4. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
